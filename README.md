# Pontoon
Project which plays the game of pontoon with AI's and battles AI's, built in summer of 2015. A detailed report of its use can be found in "Pontoon AI Designing" document.
This was the first programming project I ever created.
Reading through this project now, I can see the lack of exprience in the style of writing, through its lack of objected oriented programming.
Were I to have written this project now, I would certainly have used a plethora of appropriate functions to create a simpler structure which could be more easily edited.
I would like to assure you that my programming experience and style has developed since this early project.
